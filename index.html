                            <p>For twenty years I built cabinets for a living. In 2008 I decided to do something different.
                             Both my wife and I returned to school. I got a degree in Finance and Economics. The challenge 
                             was well worth the effort. 
                            </p>

                            <p>I have been working as a payroll tax accountant, and controller for a PEO for the last 4 years.
                                I decided to take on this new challenge to update my skills and ability to do
                                some of the personal objective I have.
                            </p>

                            <p>I still enjoy woodword, music and spending time with my family. I have two kids.
                                A douaghter who is 27, lives in Salt Lake and is a techincal writer. My second child, is a son,
                                who attends Utah State Univesity, majoring in technical writing. That get that from their mother,
                                who I've been married to for 29 years.
